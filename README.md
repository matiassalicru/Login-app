# Login App

This is an excellent and fully functional app for you to login, and know what is your uid from _firebase_!!!

## To run the app in development mode

First of all good morning, you need to clone this project to your local pc from Github, I'm sure that you already know how to do that.

In second place, when you already have the project in your local machine you need to execute the following commands:

## `npm install`

This is for you to install all the node modules with all the dependencies of the app which will make the app functional.

## `npm start`
 
This command is for run the project in development mode.

___If you want to make a production build of this project for some reason run the following command___

## `npm run build`

I'm sure that you already know all this commands, but well, its always welcome a readme :D.

Those were all the commands you need to know to make this project functional in your local pc.

### ___Thanks for readme :3.___
